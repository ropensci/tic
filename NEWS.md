  It is now optional and needs to be added as a custom block to builds. (#264)
- Add `step_session_info()`.
  This step prints the session info after having installed all dependencies in the "install" stage. (#259)
- `step_install_deps()` and `do_package_checks()` gain `dependencies = TRUE` argument.

- `use_*_yml()`: Set defaults for argument `type`.
- Fix GHA build URL and prettify deploy message (#247)
- Adjust GH Actions templates to use the `use_*_yml()` logic (#246)
- Bugfix: Packages on R-devel macOS are being installed in parallel again.

**R 4.0 toolchain**

- GitHub Actions: R-devel on macOS now uses Apples default clang compiler and the 10.13 SDK (High Sierra) to mimic the CRAN toolchain behavior.
  (The 10.15 SKD causes various issues when installing packages from source.)
- Env var `SDKROOT` is now set to `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk` to prevent linking issues on macOS >= 10.15.4

# tic 0.6.0.9002

# tic 0.6.0

## General

- `use_badge`: Refactor to use default badges from the respective providers rather than from shields.io (too slow and sometimes badges did not render at all) (#240)
- Condition deployment templates on a single runner for deployment. This avoids race conditions during deployment. This applies to all CI providers and templates (blogdown, bookdown, package) (#241)
- Files specified for deployment via `step_push_deploy(commit_paths = )` are now force added to the index by `git`.
  This enables to add directories like `docs/` (e.g. created by a local pkgdown build) to `.gitignore` and still deploy it during CI (#237).

## CI Provider specific

- add args `timeout` and `repos`
- call `rcmdcheck()` internally with `error_on = "never"` so that we can trigger the message on found warnings and notes
- remote outdated doc about `step_rcmdcheck()` using a dedicated lib for the check

# tic 0.2.13.9010

- No longer using a separate library for package checks, because it causes a lot of problems with various steps which are not aware of this (#86, #88).

- The `step_rcmdcheck()` step now installs all dependencies during preparation. The `add_package_checks()` macro no longer adds the code step that installs dependencies.

# tic 0.2.13.9007

- The `step_do_push_deploy()` and `step_push_deploy()` steps are not executed for builds on a tag, because this would create a branch of the same name as the tag (#27).

- Added integration tests for package checks and deployment, covering various common cases (#62).
- Add integration test for deploying from a subdirectory.
- Remove `orphan` argument from `step_push_deploy()`, because there's no easy way to implement it reliably. If only a subdirectory is deployed to a separate branch (i.e., the `path` argument is set), `orphan = TRUE` is required.

- New `step_add_to_drat()`.
- Split `step_push_deploy()` into `step_setup_push_deploy()` and `step_do_push_deploy()`.
- Better traceback output.
- Use "remotes" instead of "devtools".
- Reduce output after preparation (#5).
- New `step_rcmdcheck()`.
- The deparsed code is used as step name (#5).

# tic 0.2-8 (2017-06-17)

- An error occurring when running a step is printed in red (#5).

# tic 0.2-7 (2017-06-13)

- New `step_write_text_file()` for creating arbitrary text files, including `~/.R/Makevars` (#14).
- pkgdown documentation is now built for tags by default (#13).
- The "openssl" package is now only suggested, not imported.
- Removed `step_run_covr()` in favor of the new `step_run_code()` (#18).
- `load_from_file()` reloads the file from disk if its mtime changes (#11).
- All steps of a stage are run even in case of previous errors, but the stage still fails if at least one of its steps failed (#10).
- Adding to known hosts or installing a SSH keys now requires a non-interactive CI.
- New `step_run_code()` to run arbitrary code. If the code is a call with the `pkg::fun()`, notation, pkg is installed if missing (#1, #3). `step_run_covr()` remains for compatibility but is scheduled for removal.
- Color the start of each step in the log (#5).
- New `step_add_to_known_hosts()` to work around configuration problems on OS X (#16).
- Export runner methods for all stages defined in Travis CI and AppVeyor (#17).

# tic 0.2-6 (2017-06-04)

- Technical release to sync default and production branches.

# tic 0.2-5 (2016-11-27)

- Fix `after_success()` and `deploy()`.
- Step names are now printed again.

# tic 0.2-4 (2016-11-27)

- Use new DSL with the notion of stages with arbitrary names.
  - New `load_from_file()` replaces `get_xxx_steps()`
  - `task_...()` has been renamed to `step_...()`
  - A task is now something like an ad-hoc step
  - `before_script()` is now `prepare_all_stages()`
  - `TravisTask` is now `TicStep`
  - `ci()` is now exported
- If environment variable `CI` is undefined, use `LocalCI` with sensible inference of repository and branch.
- Stop if `git` exits with nonzero status.

# tic 0.2-3 (2016-11-06)

- Install package for `task_build_pkgdown` task.

# tic 0.2-2 (2016-11-05)

- DSL to define steps via `step()`, which are tasks with a branch and/or env var filter (#6).

# tic 0.2-1 (2016-11-05)

- Support environment variables from both Travis and AppVeyor (#6).
- Add tests.
- Rudimentary support for multiple CI systems.
- Clean up dependencies.

# tic 0.2 (2016-11-05)

Initial release.

- Rudimentary configuration based on task objects. A task object is a list/environment which contains at least the members `check()`, `prepare()` and `run()` -- functions without arguments, only `check()` needs to return a `logical` scalar. These can be subclasses of the new `TravisTask` R6 class, the package now contains six subclasses: `HelloWorld`, `RunCovr`, `BuildPkgdown`, `InstallSSHKeys`, `TestSSH`, and `PushDeploy`. The `new` methods of theses subclasses are exported as `task_hello_world()`, `task_run_covr()`, `task_build_pkgdown()` `task_install_ssh_keys()`, `task_test_ssh()`, and `task_push_deploy()`, respectively. The three functions `before_script()`, `after_success()` and `deploy()` accept a semicolon-separated list of task objects, which is by default taken from the `TIC_AFTER_SUCCESS_TASKS` and `TIC_DEPLOY_TASKS` environment variables. These functions call the `prepare()` and `run()` methods of the task objects if and only if the `check()` method returns `TRUE` (#42).
