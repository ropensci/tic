## Overall structure

Some sections below should be a separate vignette, with a very short summary and pointers in this "Getting started" vignette.

- Architecture and build lifecycle: In "Getting started" we only have images and flow charts
- Setup: We show how to set up a simple package check + pkgdown deployment, with links to further details
- Advanced: A full description of the DSL, with link to the "Implementation" vignette for custom steps

## Prerequisites

https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/ci.html, https://juliasilge.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-travis/, http://mahugh.com/2016/09/02/travis-ci-for-test-automation/

## Scope

What's the advantage of using _tic_?

- Easier deployment (why needed?)
- Consistent R-based DSL, easier local testing
- Internal: Decouple R-specific workflow from main travis-ci repo
    - Travis only installs R and system deps, _tic_ handles workflow

What's not covered yet?

- `SystemRequirements`


## Architecture

How do Travis CI, the _travis_ and _tic_ packages and `tic.R` interact?

## Build lifecycle

`after_xxx` are for notification only, failures anywhere else lead to build failures, see also https://travis-ci.org/krlmlr/ci-lifecycle/builds/397482622

- Flow chart?
- Caching in the build lifecycle
- Mapping of `tic` steps to the build lifecycle
    - figure in the middle of http://ctlente.com/en/purrr-magic/: `.travis.yml` -> `tic.R` -> code
    
## Setup

Link to motivation: "Easier deployment"

- Description of the tic.* example repos and the steps necessary to recreate them
    - Setup using _travis_
- Interaction with private environment variables
- Serializing R objects to strings

## Advanced

Link to motivation: "Run tests locally, R-based DSL"

- Meta-information: `ci()`
- Run _tic_ locally
- Troubleshooting
    - Linting `.travis.yml`
    - Debugging on Travis CI ("if you must")
