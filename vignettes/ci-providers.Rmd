## GitHub Actions

{tic} supports running builds on GitHub Actions on all major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).
The upstream support for the R language was developed by Jim Hester in [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions).
This repo also stores some usage [examples](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples) which differ to the {tic} approach in the following points:

- {tic} makes use of `ccache` for compiler caching enabling faster source installation of packages. 
  The `ccache` directory is cached and build once a week.
- {tic} installs packages from source on Linux by default and does not use package binaries.
- {tic} caches the complete R library and not only the direct packages dependencies (`actions` does this via `remotes::dev_package_deps(dependencies = TRUE)`). 
  The cache is built once per day.

Making use of binaries can speed up build times substantially.
This can be especially attractive for packages with many dependencies or dependencies which take a long time to install.
However, binaries do oft run into problems when the package needs linking against system libraries.
The most prominent example for this is {rJava}.
If the binary was built with the same version as the user is running on the system, everything will work.
However, often enough a different version of the system library is installed and the R packages needs to be installed from source to successfully link against it.

For the case of {rJava}, one needs to 

- add a call to `R CMD javareconf` for **macOS** runners
- add a call to `sudo R CMD javareconf` for **Linux** runners

### macOS toolchain

macOS is a bit tricky when it comes to source installation of packages.
By default `clang` is used instead of `gcc` (Linux) because the former is the default for macOS.
However, the default `clang` of macOS does not come with openMP support.
Therefore, the R macOS core devs and CRAN currently use a [custom openMP-enabled](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/) (old) version of `clang` to build the CRAN package binaries.
In {tic} we reflect this by installing `clang7` and `clang8` for the respective R version during build initialization in the "ccache" stages.

### rJava

If Java support is required, add the following for macOS runners:

```yaml
      - name: "[macOS] rJava"
        if: runner.os == 'macOS'
        run: |
          R CMD javareconf
          Rscript -e "install.packages('rJava', type = 'source')"
```

For Linux, add `sudo R CMD javareconf` to stage "[Linux] Prepare".
We currently do not support Java on Windows.

### ccache

If you have a huge dependency chain and compiling many packages from source (especially on R-devel), `ccache` can help to speed up package installation.
It is recommended once your dependency installation time is higher than 30 minutes.

Once the `ccache` cache is build, compilation will complete much faster.
The `ccache` cache itself is only invalidated once a month.
This means package installation can make use of the cache in 29/30 days in a month.

The downside is that `ccache` needs to be installed and configured.
This happens in every run, i.e. also in runs in which `ccache` is not used because a package cache already exists.
Installation can take up to 1 min, depending on the platform.
Note that `ccache` won't be used on Windows since only binaries are used on this platform.

You can take the following blocks and add/replace them to your `tic.yml` as needed.
The essential part is to prefix the compiler settings in `~/.R/Makevars` with `ccache`.

```yml
      - name: "[Custom] [Cache] Prepare weekly timestamp for cache"
        if: runner.os != 'Windows'
        id: datew
        run: echo "::set-output name=datew::$(date '+%Y-%V')"
        
        
      - name: "[Custom] [Cache] Cache ccache"
        if: runner.os != 'Windows'
        uses: pat-s/always-upload-cache@v2.0.0
        with:
          path: ${{ env.CCACHE_DIR}}
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-r-${{ matrix.config.r }}-ccache-${{steps.datew.outputs.datew}}
          restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-r-${{ matrix.config.r }}-ccache-${{steps.datew.outputs.datew}}
          
      # install ccache and write config file
      # mirror the setup described in https://github.com/rmacoslib/r-macos-rtools
      - name: "[Custom] [macOS] ccache"
        if: runner.os == 'macOS' && matrix.config.r == 'devel'
        run: |
          brew install ccache
          # set compiler flags
          mkdir -p ~/.R && echo -e 'CC=ccache clang\nCPP=ccache clang\nCXX=ccache clang++\nCXX11=ccache clang++\nCXX14=ccache clang++\nCXX17=ccache clang++\nCFLAGS=-isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.13.sdk\nCCFLAGS=-isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.13.sdk\nCXXFLAGS=-isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.13.sdk\nCPPFLAGS=-isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.13.sdk\nF77=ccache /usr/local/gfortran/bin/gfortran\nFC=ccache /usr/local/gfortran/bin/gfortran' > $HOME/.R/Makevars

      # install ccache and write config file
      - name: "[Custom] [Linux] ccache"
        if: runner.os == 'Linux'
        run: |
          sudo apt install ccache libcurl4-openssl-dev
          mkdir -p ~/.R && echo -e 'CC=ccache gcc -std=gnu99\nCXX=ccache g++\nFC=ccache gfortran\nF77=ccache gfortran' > $HOME/.R/Makevars
```

### Spatial libraries (gdal, proj, geos)

For spatial packages on macOS, we currently recommend building against the latest GDAL and PROJ v5:

```yaml
brew tap osgeo/osgeo4mac
brew install gdal
brew unlink proj
brew install osgeo-proj@5
brew link --force osgeo-proj@5
```

On Linux, add `libgdal-dev libproj-dev libgeos-dev` to the `apt install` call in the "[Linux] Prepare" stage.
